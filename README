Introduction
-------------

Statsd over SLF4J is a Java statsd client, combined with an SLF4J compatible logging facility.

The idea is that SLF4J logger names and statsd keys are both dot separated namespaces, so why not use them together.
At the same time, we gain control over our statsd stats logging via familiar logging configuration files. A logback
logging appender implementation is provided.
